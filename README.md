### Introduction

This repository is a personalised fork of the [DengFOC_FFBKnob](https://github.com/ToanTech/DengFOC_FFBKnob). I leant the logic of codes from its offical course but I coded it myself and did some changes in variables, sequency of codes and the coding habit to match my own styles.

The hardware is bounght from Deng's TAOBAO shop.

Be very thankful for their kind and generous online course, which is extremely helpful for the people (actually me) who want to learn how these force feedback knobs work. They provide an oppourtunity to begin with simple and easy things, there are no much hard codes nor difficult logics. This is the initial step of my studying is electrical and electronic engineering.

I didn't come to request a song. I only wanted to say *Thank you*.
